# File handling with s3

This example project serves as an exploration of Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) capabilities, showcasing an implementation of some key features for developers. The project focuses on various aspects, including upload and download functionalities using signed URLs, bucket versioning, archiving, retrieval, and multipart uploads.

The project uses [SST](https://sst.dev) for deploying AWS Resources and [Turso](https://turso.tech) for storing data in a SQLite Database.
UI is built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) but can be easily replaced with a technology of your choosing. [React Form](https://react.email/) is used for
composing a HTML Email.

## Signed URLs for Secure Uploads and Downloads

Demonstrates the implementation of AWS S3 signed URLs to securely upload and download files. This ensures that only authorized users with the correct credentials can perform these actions.

## Bucket Versioning

Illustrates the benefits of enabling bucket versioning in AWS S3, allowing for the management of different versions of objects within a bucket. This feature enhances data protection and provides a mechanism for easy rollback in case of unintended modifications.
